d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/40-0
00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.799
Do we have everyone in the call
from MTP?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/51-0
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.089
Yes, I think maybe in both said
there.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/56-0
00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:15.879
If it is that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/71-0
00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:22.844
OK, so Bono will be joining
soon. So can we get started with

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/71-1
00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:23.829
the STS X?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/79-0
00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.459
You know the open points Rahul
and Michael.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/99-0
00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.283
OK. But that's in the interface
STS ** so it doesn't really need

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/97-0
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.449
Yeah, Andrew.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/99-1
00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:33.399
everyone on the call.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/118-0
00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:38.911
Ohh OK, because as we are
waiting for banana, so if we can

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/106-0
00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.869
It's not.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/118-1
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:40.679
get started with that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/128-0
00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.179
Everyone, sorry for being late.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/127-0
00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.119
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/131-0
00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:48.749
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/133-0
00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.519
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/156-0
00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.706
So maybe we can take that
interface at the end. Michael,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/167-0
00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.924
Yeah. Otherwise we can have a
short meeting with a few people

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/156-1
00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:56.649
we can, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/164-0
00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.649
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/166-0
00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:57.659
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/167-1
00:02:57.924 --> 00:02:58.099
did.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/211-0
00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.159
Ohh actually hopefully this
should be a short meeting. I

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/211-1
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.601
we've already signed off our
version 4 of the Custom FRS. I

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/211-2
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:13.339
quickly just wanted to check in
on the OQ scenario document and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/211-3
00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.485
then the CPLD. So which one
would we like to start with

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/211-4
00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:17.929
first?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/220-0
00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.529
Ohh sorry, I'm gonna go wreck
you something before.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/252-0
00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.473
But don't think for Iraqi sounds
not on this call, but I know

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/252-1
00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:36.339
she's been looking at them. If
anyone else wants to talk about

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/252-2
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.039
focus scenarios, cause I guess
some movies.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/262-0
00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.669
You know, we we don't call
auction for this meeting, so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/277-0
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.689
We're going to proceed to
project screen. Ohh you see it?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/271-0
00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:48.859
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/286-0
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.088
From a business perspective,
Kawasaki SAN is the okay

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/286-1
00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:54.219
scenario document OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/289-0
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.649
Hmm yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/293-0
00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.809
OKOK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/304-0
00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.849
Um and Michael, I saw your mail
regarding the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/319-0
00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.286
The reporting rules, as well as
the Northern Ireland license

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/319-1
00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:08.109
configuration.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/324-0
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:09.549
Yeah, we're getting the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/339-0
00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.541
I'm understanding that the
system is correct, we just need

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/339-1
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:14.539
to document it correctly in the
CBD, correct?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/340-0
00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:15.299
Exactly.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/342-0
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.229
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/372-0
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.973
So we'll take care of that and
hopefully post this. Can we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/372-1
00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:26.165
presume that we can start the
approval of CBD or is there

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/372-2
00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.779
something that you would like to
discuss in that?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/384-0
00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.822
We're still going through the
comments and the feedback of the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/384-1
00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:34.169
updates.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/386-0
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:36.099
Okay.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/435-0
00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:41.823
So besides this, the only other
thing that's going to be coming

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/435-1
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.479
from our end today is going to
be the PQ scenario document as

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/435-2
00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.841
well. So now that the UFR is
versions and everything are

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/435-3
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:52.438
final, we will be cleaning that
up as well and sending it to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/435-4
00:04:52.438 --> 00:04:52.969
everyone.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/453-0
00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.501
Any other comments or anything
else that we d like to talk

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/453-1
00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:00.909
about? Streets. It's actually a
short meeting from my side.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/464-0
00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:04.559
Impact assessment document is a
new version of that coming.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/466-0
00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.709
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/468-0
00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:10.079
Next week.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/471-0
00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:11.599
Next week.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/497-0
00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.523
It will be early next week,
Michael, but I don't see any

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/497-1
00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:24.556
major updates required for
impact assessment. Is it right

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/493-0
00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.699
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/497-2
00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:27.199
understanding? Ohh founder and
Rahul.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/509-0
00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.083
Yes. Ohh my clean pack. From a
business perspective I don't see

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/509-1
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:34.899
any changes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-0
00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:42.543
There are. There are just.
There's just one this, this one

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-1
00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:46.414
trigger that we've disabled for
the J21B population, which is

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-2
00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:49.848
working seamlessly now out of
the box and therefore we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-3
00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:53.657
wouldn't marked that as an out
of the box requirement in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-4
00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:57.403
east to be document from a
custom ufrs perspective. The new

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/562-5
00:05:57.403 --> 00:05:59.089
pre saves that we've added.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/576-0
00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:02.466
After modifying the field
validations, that would also go

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/576-1
00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:04.649
into the field, the impact
assessment document.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/606-0
00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:09.464
And of course, the the new
things that we had for Taiwan

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/606-1
00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:13.310
Ft, so those are the 3 things
that I'm anticipating should be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/606-2
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.729
updated in the impact
assessment, but.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/610-0
00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:17.879
Really nothing else.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/625-0
00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.752
I think the interfaces section
might need some update, given

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/625-1
00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:23.549
that we've discovered that like
the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/645-0
00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:28.837
The default sort order in Oracle
19 C seems to behave differently

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/645-1
00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:30.979
to 12 C when these type of
things.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/662-0
00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.623
Farrell knows the details of the
issues. We sort of walked

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/662-1
00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:42.387
through on those interfaces, so
probably need some update in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/662-2
00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:42.659
there.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/668-0
00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.399
Rahul, if you are speaking,
you're on mute.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/670-0
00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.919
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/692-0
00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:55.329
You are Michael there certain,
like a couple of issues that we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/692-1
00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:58.632
have an independent that have to
be included in practice

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/692-2
00:06:58.632 --> 00:06:59.269
assessment.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/696-0
00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:08.549
Like the one.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/698-0
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:11.549
Where?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-0
00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.116
They're better working in 812,
but somehow due to some bug in 8

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-1
00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:22.745
or 4 system and they they are
not performing the same thing.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-2
00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:27.223
So those will be included in
impact assessment. Like if we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-3
00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:31.852
consider J9, J, 10 for example
for a genetic profile so that

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/740-0
00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:31.209
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-4
00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:36.405
has to be included. We have
noted that down while preparing

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/756-5
00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:36.709
SSX.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/759-0
00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:37.639
But.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/765-0
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.219
So we'll have that included.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/778-0
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.255
So ohh bounded. Do we need any
confirmation? Clarification on

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/778-1
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:54.599
comments of scenarios.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/822-0
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:01.568
No, I actually just had one
comment from neither San in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/822-1
00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:05.888
office scenario document which
was that you know we should have

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/822-2
00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:10.207
a downgrade and a nullification
scenarios and Nathan have added

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/822-3
00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:14.459
that in the PMD mfds OQ. I've
added that scenario so that the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-0
00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:19.026
You know the requirements that
you're mentioning will be mapped

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-1
00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:22.833
over there. And Kawasaki San had
also requested that when we're

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-2
00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:26.759
testing E2, BR 2 license partner
import, we test do one test with

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-3
00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.328
a duct study because there's
something that we also want to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-4
00:08:30.328 --> 00:08:34.076
verify on the J side of things.
And Kawasaki SANA have updated

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/882-5
00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:34.849
that as well.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/898-0
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:40.087
So there's no comment that I've
not accepted. All comments have

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/920-0
00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:47.299
Nice. I think I have added the 2
comment in this moment and you

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/898-1
00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.019
been accepted.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/920-1
00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:48.449
could you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/919-0
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:49.279
Also new comments.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/922-0
00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:50.209
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/928-0
00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:51.639
For that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/927-0
00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:51.609
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/933-0
00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:54.469
Ohh I think I did scenario.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/943-0
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:57.829
Was I using the customer vision
before this?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/950-0
00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:03.829
Let me have a look come.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/970-0
00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.697
Ohh, let me bring up my screen
and cover service and maybe you

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/970-1
00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:25.269
can just tell me which comment
we're referring to.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/975-0
00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:35.529
Are you?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/984-0
00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:38.939
Is my screen visible for
everyone?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/991-0
00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.809
Ohh yes I can see your screen
and.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/995-0
00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:44.779
If something like scenarios.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1006-0
00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:50.049
I don't have any description in
come H just occasionally.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1009-0
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.599
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1011-0
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:08.879
Well.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1013-0
00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:10.539
Ohh yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1057-0
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:23.876
Ohh so being the only place we
were actually not mentioned. The

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1057-1
00:10:23.876 --> 00:10:28.726
test cases are oq 6 onwards and
that is because these oq who's

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1028-0
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:25.269
Hmm.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1057-2
00:10:28.726 --> 00:10:33.268
are actually having multiple
cases inside them, they don't

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1057-3
00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:37.579
have just one single case. For
example to test out the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1049-0
00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:33.929
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-0
00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:42.360
The 4 saves because there are
multiple post saves in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-1
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.519
system and then we're also
testing advanced auto labelling.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-2
00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:50.956
There are going to be 10 or 20
cases inside this thing, so it's

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1086-0
00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:48.689
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-3
00:10:50.956 --> 00:10:55.323
not possible for us to mention
each kind of case and in in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-4
00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:59.412
example of post saves, it
doesn't matter what kind of case

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-5
00:10:59.412 --> 00:11:03.710
it is, what we want to verify is
that when the case is routed

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-6
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.146
from X workflow to why workflow
whatever post say was mentioned

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1133-7
00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:08.909
in the UFR.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1154-0
00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:13.495
That is getting tested or not
both positively and negatively.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1154-1
00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:17.149
So for that reason only doesn't
make sense to specify the test

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1154-2
00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:18.019
case over here.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1166-0
00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:22.709
I understood, but can you add
some discussion so?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1170-0
00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:25.749
Like like a multiple cases.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1179-0
00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.319
And my brother doesn't think.
I'm not sure how to search.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1207-0
00:11:33.469 --> 00:11:37.481
That was like 10. Would it help
if I can provide you the oki

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1207-1
00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:41.690
only the OK for this thing has
been already authored. And Ryan,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1207-2
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.189
which is doing one final peer
review.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1222-0
00:11:45.189 --> 00:11:48.096
If that is done, would it help
if I provide you the entire okay

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1222-1
00:11:48.096 --> 00:11:49.959
only the data sheet has all the
details.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1230-0
00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:54.749
Yeah, I just hope she had
covered this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1245-0
00:11:55.939 --> 00:12:01.969
This OQ scenario, the material
should be voted upon one.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1255-0
00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:05.069
So I think.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1266-0
00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:07.601
Yes, but I checked internally
it's not mandatory for us to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1266-1
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.719
specify the test case scenario.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1274-0
00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:11.939
For things like this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1295-0
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:15.039
Yeah. So, yeah, I'm I'm so
please add some discussion that

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1295-1
00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:19.020
this this will will use
multiplication or something like

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1295-2
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.369
that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1303-0
00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:24.729
So you're saying like a high
level overview?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1306-0
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:25.699
Ohh yes, like that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1324-0
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.249
Just a statement to the fact
that there are multiple cases.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1313-0
00:12:26.089 --> 00:12:26.789
Okay got it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1327-0
00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:30.679
Sure. Got it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1343-0
00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.159
Thanks 36 and 37 7 on it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1359-0
00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:57.291
Got it. So for 36 and 37 both,
I'll add a very high level

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1359-1
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:58.749
overview over here.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1361-0
00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:02.289
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1371-0
00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:05.119
OK. Anything else that was like,
yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1369-0
00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:04.489
Yes, that's fine.

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:11.979
Any comments from Arakan on this

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1399-0
00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:15.452
Ohh Minoru San, I think they

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1399-1
00:13:15.452 --> 00:13:16.179

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1435-0
00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:33.539

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1437-0
00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:34.909
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1453-0
00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:39.552
OK. Anyway, she's. She's still
looking at the documents that

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1453-1
00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.019

moment.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1458-0
00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:43.419
I didn't want.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1459-0
00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:43.459
So.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1476-0
00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:47.410
I'm sure she'll lose out the
comments, so if if if they're

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1470-0
00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:46.439
Sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1475-0
00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:47.489
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1476-1
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:47.669
good.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1488-0
00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:50.989
OK, so I'll address this one.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1486-0
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:50.529
So if visa.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1490-0
00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:51.809
Sorry.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1505-0
00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:55.869
If these are addressed, we are
good to close this document.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1499-0
00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:53.829
Sudden.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1509-0
00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:57.779
You're almost there.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1511-0
00:13:58.309 --> 00:13:58.589
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1521-0
00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:02.299
That's about the end of the day.
We should be good on this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1524-0
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.649
Okay great.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1539-0
00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:09.317
So the next is scenario I think
do we need any clarification

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1539-1
00:14:09.317 --> 00:14:11.619
bound on the PQ scenario? Sorry.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1541-0
00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:14.079
Hmm.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1545-0
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.149
No, not at all.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1550-0
00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:17.529
We are go down that OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1564-0
00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:31.412
So Rahul, can we talk about that
Taiwan issue, what we discussed

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1564-1
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.199
along with Varna yesterday?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1574-0
00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:44.709
Yes, my understand. Ohh I'll
share my screen for that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1587-0
00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:02.119
Like premium and you can see the
screen.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1592-0
00:15:12.849 --> 00:15:13.199
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1596-0
00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:15.409
Yeah. Cancel.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1613-0
00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:21.601
Okay this is an older version of
document, so that's why it's

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1613-1
00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:23.049
pending return over here.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1656-0
00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:28.404
Uh, it's regarding this point
where we were discussing, like

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1656-1
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:33.104
how the how the reports will
mark the submitted in August. So

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1656-2
00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:37.805
basically as per our discussion
with Brennan, we we sought to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1656-3
00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:42.582
have 2 options for this while
for marking report and submitted

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1656-4
00:15:42.582 --> 00:15:42.809
so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-0
00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:48.536
Ohh as it was being done earlier
that there was a job that was

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-1
00:15:48.536 --> 00:15:53.081
running twice a day like this
job and it was basically

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-2
00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:58.288
converting the moving the files
into zip file and then sending

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-3
00:15:58.288 --> 00:16:03.329
it to Taiwan authority. So as
soon as the files are moved to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-4
00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:08.701
zip file via custom procedure in
August so then only the reports

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1715-0
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:07.799
2.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1727-5
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:12.999
are marked as submitted via
backend process. OK so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1750-0
00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:18.350
And now that that actually
utility that that's not a custom

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1750-1
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:23.339
one. So now that is taking care
of zipping the files so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-0
00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:28.863
Does the Penguin happen as soon
as it's available in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-1
00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:34.094
location and it'll be it'll be
moved to move it? It'll be sent

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-2
00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:39.492
to Taiwan where mail. OK, so now
that the previous functionality

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-3
00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:44.226
is no longer working, so we
won't be having the existing

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-4
00:16:44.226 --> 00:16:49.125
process of of submitting the
files. So I'm back in process

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1813-5
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:53.859
now either we can use an use the
Oracle feature that is.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1866-0
00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:59.740
As soon as the the files are
generated in the out folder, so

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1866-1
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.600
it'll be updating the date
submitted. Either that is one of

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1866-2
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.541
the option or like or the other
option is that that when the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1866-3
00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:14.563
files were sent to files are
sent to Taiwan and we'll get the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1866-4
00:17:14.563 --> 00:17:16.669
mail from Taiwan SOOK and.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1915-0
00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:21.529
That'll be decompressed by X
ray, and those acts will be used

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1915-1
00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:24.879
for populating the submission
date in August. So these are

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1915-2
00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:28.399
basically the 2 options that we
discussed with Vernon. So so,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1915-3
00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:31.920
Michael, are we clear on this?
Then we'll talk about the pros

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1915-4
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.339
and cons of these things.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1922-0
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:36.689
Yeah, I thought that we've
already.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1928-0
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:38.489
Decided on this nut.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1941-0
00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:43.339
The the ACT process will the the
Act will be received from the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1944-0
00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:44.789
And then that will.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1949-0
00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.129
Do the submission date.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1964-0
00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:52.529
So OK, so, so the act that will
be sent by LS O right over mail.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1966-0
00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:53.499
Yes, yes, yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1991-0
00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:58.261
Thanks. So so Michael, there is
a thing over there that if we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1991-1
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:02.898
are getting the end waiting for
egg, so it it may not be an

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/1991-2
00:18:02.898 --> 00:18:04.289
immediate process.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2016-0
00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:10.789
Okay it may take a couple of
days for that and that will be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2016-1
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:15.514
reflected late in the system.
Even though the case is

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2016-2
00:18:15.514 --> 00:18:18.139
submitted at Taiwan's and but.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2064-0
00:18:19.129 --> 00:18:22.962
Then they'll be sending the
mail. We don't know that exactly

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2064-1
00:18:22.962 --> 00:18:26.794
whether it will be 2 or 3 days
when will be getting that act

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2064-2
00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:30.815
back and then only it will mark
the system. So it'll already be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2064-3
00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:34.711
a late date when the report was
actually submitted in this in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2064-4
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:35.339
the FD is.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2083-0
00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:42.265
So that is the biggest phones in
that because because of the late

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2083-1
00:18:42.265 --> 00:18:44.289
data available in the system.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2101-0
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:52.344
So are we good with this having
a late date updated in the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2101-1
00:18:52.344 --> 00:18:54.749
system? If so then then it's OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2104-0
00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:01.689
No.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2129-0
00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:10.076
And the other option that we
were talking about is that

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2129-1
00:19:10.076 --> 00:19:15.021
updating the date submitted as
soon as the files are generated.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2129-2
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:15.639
OK, the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-0
00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:20.968
It's gone over. There is the
negative thing that that is that

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-1
00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:24.738
when if even like, well, the
reports will be marked as

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-2
00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:28.987
submitted as soon as the files
are generated OK our file like

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-3
00:19:28.987 --> 00:19:33.442
files are sent so point is that
if we are getting a negative act

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-4
00:19:33.442 --> 00:19:37.691
the user has to do that upgrade
manually because the file has

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2187-0
00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:37.819
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-5
00:19:37.691 --> 00:19:41.871
already been submitted. So in
case of negative back a manual

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2197-0
00:19:40.369 --> 00:19:40.889
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2205-6
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:43.859
process has to be taken care.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2211-0
00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:45.799
To handle these things.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2216-0
00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.069
Yeah, we want to avoid that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2220-0
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:49.829
We are right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2224-0
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:51.219
So.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2232-0
00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:53.539
OK, I understand the options.
Let me think about that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2235-0
00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:54.229
Young.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2265-0
00:19:55.139 --> 00:19:59.419
Show my God. So my girl can you?
Can we have a decision now or

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2248-0
00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.099
Because like.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2265-1
00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:03.019
we'll discuss it internally and
then get back to us.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2270-0
00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:04.769
Yes, I'm discuss it and get back
to you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2273-0
00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:06.799
So thank you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2287-0
00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:21.634
Okay, Michael. So we just wanted
to have a clarity on this, so

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2287-1
00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:23.359
that there will not be any.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2296-0
00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:28.249
Open items when we move forward
to validation.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2298-0
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:29.939
Yeah. Good.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2301-0
00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:34.009
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2309-0
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:36.319
Michael also have a very small
update.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2329-0
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:40.662
Hmm, it doesn't impact anything,
but just so that you know, we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2329-1
00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:44.458
can close the loop on it.
Remember the bug that we had on

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2329-2
00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:45.309
event groups?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2331-0
00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:46.389
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2344-0
00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:52.089
So, um, we went back into the
system and we did a small POC.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2384-0
00:20:52.809 --> 00:20:56.329
The issue is there if by any
chance you have an advanced

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2384-1
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:59.973
condition in the system where
you're referencing the event

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2384-2
00:20:59.973 --> 00:21:03.679
group ID. So if you have an
advanced condition where you're

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2384-3
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:06.149
saying you know LM even group
equal to.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2393-0
00:21:06.889 --> 00:21:09.149
100,000, blah blah, blah blah
blah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2391-0
00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:08.749
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2425-0
00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:13.609
That's when that bug is
occurring. However, thankfully

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2402-0
00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:13.969
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2425-1
00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:18.012
in the MD environment, because I
did a small PC, I created a test

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2425-2
00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:21.949
reporting room and everything
was working correctly in it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2416-0
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:18.299
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2440-0
00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:28.169
The catch is if you create the
advanced condition with the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2440-1
00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:29.549
event group name.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2444-0
00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.389
Not the ID.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2449-0
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.689
Then there is no issue.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2452-0
00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:35.609
OK, right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2481-0
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:40.446
So Raul's already done one
sanity check in the system, and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2481-1
00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:44.395
he's confirmed that there are no
C that are pulling the event

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2481-2
00:21:44.395 --> 00:21:48.534
group ID. If you'd like to just
cross verify something from your

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2481-3
00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:48.789
end.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2504-0
00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:53.447
Please feel free to do so, but
for our understanding then we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2504-1
00:21:53.447 --> 00:21:56.731
will say that for the MTP
system, there's no impact for

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2504-2
00:21:56.731 --> 00:21:57.259
this bug.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2512-0
00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:00.819
OK, sure. Will double check on
it. Thank you for the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2512-1
00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:01.349
explanation.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2514-0
00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:02.579
Thank you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2522-0
00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:12.719
Wanna do? We need any discussion
on CBD?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2526-0
00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:14.299
Open items.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2567-0
00:22:16.589 --> 00:22:19.840
I would say yes if we if we are
at a stage where we've gone

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2567-1
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.308
through the entire CD and there
are any review comments that we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2567-2
00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:26.667
can close and discuss. But I
have a feeling that maybe MTP is

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2567-3
00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:29.755
just reviewing everything right
now. Is my understanding

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2564-0
00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:29.459
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2567-4
00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:30.189
correct?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2585-0
00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:34.502
I'm definitely still reviewing
things I don't know if anyone

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2585-1
00:22:34.502 --> 00:22:37.199
else has any specific points on
the CBD they want to discuss.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2592-0
00:22:37.829 --> 00:22:39.339
It's not as fun or comparison.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2599-0
00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:44.939
I don't have any special
guidance.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2602-0
00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:46.359
No.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2614-0
00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:50.099
OK, so we'll keep reviewing why
you know.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2613-0
00:22:49.689 --> 00:22:50.129
You can.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2634-0
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:54.310
Perhaps when orders on what we
can do is if we if we get a

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2634-1
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.079
collated list of all the review
comments by Monday.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2639-0
00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:57.929
The.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2658-0
00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:01.252
There's something that we can't
address. Maybe we can just

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2658-1
00:23:01.252 --> 00:23:04.771
utilise half an hour of our
Monday meeting, the last half an

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2658-2
00:23:04.771 --> 00:23:05.059
hour.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2661-0
00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:06.699
Yeah, sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2663-0
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:08.019
Sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2676-0
00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:20.997
OK. Any other points of
discussion related to you know

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/2676-1

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3246-0
00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:09.129
Yeah.

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:11.549
The blue coloured sheets, if I'm
right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3261-0
00:28:12.109 --> 00:28:13.169
Something like that, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3270-0
00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:16.879
Yeah, there are 70 plus sheets
in the CBD.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3280-0
00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:19.769
We have lots of coloured tabs in
many documents.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3301-0
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:28.381
I I will check that the PVQ test
plan. OK so we can start looking

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3301-1
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:29.729
into it, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3299-0
00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:29.189
Looking at.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3307-0
00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:33.199
Sure, this is understood.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3322-0
00:28:34.569 --> 00:28:37.279
Pick your sweet like you said.
No, we talked about yesterday.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3321-0
00:28:36.899 --> 00:28:37.219
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3324-0
00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:38.449
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3326-0
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:40.319
Schedule.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3328-0
00:28:40.729 --> 00:28:40.969
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3340-0
00:28:42.369 --> 00:28:46.749
OK, so that's another some of
the key points.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3352-0
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:50.611
So if no other points, you know
that we can switch over to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3352-1
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.309
interface SSX.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3359-0
00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:54.169
And we can ask, you know?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3363-0
00:28:54.969 --> 00:28:55.929
The people who are.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3366-0
00:28:56.879 --> 00:28:57.739
Not interested.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3371-0
00:28:57.889 --> 00:29:00.029
Not interested can drop.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3373-0
00:29:03.629 --> 00:29:03.949
Thank you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3378-0
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.479
Because.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3384-0
00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:08.089
Anyone has any points? Yeah,
sorry.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3394-0
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:10.669
Anything else before we switch
over the interface document?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3416-0
00:29:13.639 --> 00:29:18.365
Ohh no sorry it to sorry
Japanese. Ohh no macaroni still

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3416-1
00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:20.189
kickin estimate today.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3450-0
00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:24.786
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, OK that this is what I

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3424-0
00:29:20.609 --> 00:29:21.639
Thinking about hi.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3429-0
00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:23.609
Hey.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3450-1
00:29:24.786 --> 00:29:28.519
wanted to discuss. Somehow slip
my mind. Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3437-0
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:25.239
Thank you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3452-0
00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:29.359
Yes, yes, send.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3461-0
00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:32.599
OK, so bahana, yeah, that is so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3459-0
00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:31.389
And.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3465-0
00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:33.369
Ohh go ahead.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3466-0
00:29:33.309 --> 00:29:33.489
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3480-0
00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:38.229
The estimation what we had
discussed in a day back, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3481-0
00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:38.579
Yes, yes, yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3516-0
00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:46.777
Ohh, so basically Kawasaki SAN
and Nathan we need 2 users per

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3516-1
00:29:46.777 --> 00:29:54.092
user group for PQ execution, 7
days, 7 PQ. We need 2 users per

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3516-2
00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:55.369
user group.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3534-0
00:30:01.169 --> 00:30:04.803
So all the active user groups we
have in the system, we will need

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3534-1
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.069
2 users per user group.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3558-0
00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:21.251
Above, there's no problem if,
for example, one user has book

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3540-0
00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:15.629
It doesn't work.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3558-1
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:22.999
in data entry QC.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3561-0
00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:25.389
Rolls together.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3592-0
00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:30.201
Yeah, yeah, that's not an issue
at all. If if that is a normal

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3592-1
00:30:30.201 --> 00:30:34.219
business practice, please feel
free to have that user be part

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3577-0
00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:31.629
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3592-2
00:30:34.219 --> 00:30:37.459
of the pqq execution. In fact,
it's a good thing.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3594-0
00:30:38.829 --> 00:30:39.089
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-0
00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:42.554
Because it will save a lot of
logging and then logout steps.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-1
00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:45.944
Although we will have that
documented in because we don't

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-2
00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:49.567
know what kind of loser will be
there. So we will have log in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-3
00:30:49.567 --> 00:30:53.249
and logout documented on every
you know workflow state change.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-4
00:30:53.249 --> 00:30:57.048
However if the person is of the
same user group, that's an added

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3640-5
00:30:57.048 --> 00:30:57.399
bonus.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3658-0
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:02.592
And the only reason we're asking
for 2 users, Michael and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3658-1
00:31:02.592 --> 00:31:06.889
Kazakhstan is some of these
cases, especially PQ one and 2.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-0
00:31:07.749 --> 00:31:11.619
We are expecting bigger 12 and
the EMA import, we're expecting

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-1
00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:15.243
that it would be processed by
the global first and then it

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-2
00:31:15.243 --> 00:31:19.297
will be coming to the Japan team
for that reason. And that reason

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-3
00:31:19.297 --> 00:31:22.921
only we're requesting for 2
years 2 users because we don't

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-4
00:31:22.921 --> 00:31:26.852
want to be short on time as such
a target is one PQ executed in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3727-5
00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:30.599
one entirety, but because some
cases will be changing hands.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3769-0
00:31:31.729 --> 00:31:35.877
We think that maybe some BQ
might be executed in 2 days

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3769-1
00:31:35.877 --> 00:31:40.544
because day one, they might be
executed by the global Team Day

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3769-2
00:31:40.544 --> 00:31:45.433
2, they might be executed by the
local team and for that Reason 2

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3769-3
00:31:45.433 --> 00:31:46.989
users per user group.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3780-0
00:31:51.459 --> 00:31:53.019
Alright, cause I can send you an
assistant.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3788-0
00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:08.289
I can't hear you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3791-0
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:10.909
So.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3815-0
00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:17.064
We don't have to have individual
users per user group. We can, as

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3815-1
00:32:17.064 --> 00:32:21.634
we discussed internally one one
user can be along to multiple

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3806-0
00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:18.849
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3815-2
00:32:21.634 --> 00:32:22.519
user groups.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3818-0
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.329
The.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3820-0
00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:24.239
Hmm.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3829-0
00:32:24.589 --> 00:32:27.129
The script will mention to
logout and log in.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3833-0
00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:28.319
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3841-0
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:33.249
But the the user can just press,
take pass and move on.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3843-0
00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:34.339
Hmm.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-0
00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:39.394
Ohh password not applicable.
Conversely sign and they can

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3849-0
00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:35.949
If I have.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-1
00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:43.546
move on. We just have one
request though. Whosoever does

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-2
00:32:43.546 --> 00:32:48.136
the PQ dry run should be doing
the PQ actual execution as well

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-3
00:32:48.136 --> 00:32:52.579
because you know if they have
any questions. If they want to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-4
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:57.314
understand something new in the
84 system, let that cycle happen

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-5
00:32:57.314 --> 00:33:01.758
during the PQ dry run phase
where we still have some time to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3913-6
00:33:01.758 --> 00:33:05.619
answer those questions and fix
things. If we have a.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3943-0
00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:09.252
A different user doing the PQ
dry run and then we have a

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3943-1
00:33:09.252 --> 00:33:12.812
different user doing the actual
PQ execution. That's where we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3943-2
00:33:12.812 --> 00:33:14.649
will start having some problems.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3964-0
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:21.479
You know we have we are planning
to assign same size as the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3964-1
00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:24.269
driver and actually discussion.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3966-0
00:33:24.749 --> 00:33:25.609
Omar limitation.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3975-0
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:27.819
That would be perfect. Thank you
so much, Kawasaki, man.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3981-0
00:33:28.499 --> 00:33:29.909
But not yet decided.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3983-0
00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:31.449
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/3997-0
00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:46.999
So we will have 7 days for PQ
execution connection, so we.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4008-0
00:33:48.209 --> 00:33:52.377
With that, you know we have to
keep that in mind to for Peaky

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4008-1
00:33:52.377 --> 00:33:53.049
execution.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4011-0
00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:54.469
Members.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4013-0
00:33:55.979 --> 00:33:56.369
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4034-0
00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:01.591
And in the in the plan, how much
scope have you got for any

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4034-1
00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:05.149
reruns? I know we shouldn't have
them, but they happen.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4037-0
00:34:06.449 --> 00:34:06.779
You.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4049-0
00:34:08.029 --> 00:34:11.189
We should never do as much as
possible, but yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4050-0
00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:11.739
You.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4052-0
00:34:12.939 --> 00:34:13.409
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4058-0
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:19.159
We have only 2 days for reason.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4061-0
00:34:20.509 --> 00:34:21.359
OK. Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4087-0
00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:25.817
You see issues happen early on
in the PQ. Then you know things

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4087-1
00:34:25.817 --> 00:34:28.972
can be done in parallel and see
if they happened towards the end

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4077-0
00:34:26.029 --> 00:34:26.279
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4087-2
00:34:28.972 --> 00:34:29.749
and get problem.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4089-0
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:31.819
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4094-0
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:33.519
Keep it in mind.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4100-0
00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:35.459
Costs. Yeah, now onwards, I
mean.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4114-0
00:34:36.749 --> 00:34:40.818
The timeline is very tight on
the scripts we have to conform

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4114-1
00:34:40.818 --> 00:34:41.619
and move on.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4116-0
00:34:42.519 --> 00:34:42.919
Quickly.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4118-0
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:44.089
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4121-0
00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:55.289
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4132-0
00:34:57.359 --> 00:35:00.179
So ohh sorry. Yeah. Any other
points by anyone?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4145-0
00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:06.779
Ohh sorry, I'm signed with

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4166-0
00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:13.969
Cause I'm not concerned we have
some ISIS referring bgd.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4157-0
00:35:08.379 --> 00:35:09.149
Yes, coming second.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4175-0
00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:21.959
I share my screen just a moment
please.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4177-0
00:35:21.749 --> 00:35:21.989
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4179-0
00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:24.889
Okay.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4183-0
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:27.309
Which you might just joke.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4185-0
00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:30.079
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4231-0
00:35:33.979 --> 00:35:38.360
Ohh this this one is OK because
after EGID it's looking at Event

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4195-0
00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:36.929
Ohh it's one.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4231-1
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.674
Group name in the clause. After
that it's looking at even group

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4208-0
00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:41.829
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4231-2
00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:47.123
name. The problem is coming when
it's looking at what event group

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4231-3
00:35:47.123 --> 00:35:50.089
ID equal to. Then like a hard
coded number.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4239-0
00:35:50.529 --> 00:35:52.659
Down with it. So let's see.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4246-0
00:35:53.969 --> 00:35:56.429
Tell you something. Here she
goes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4253-0
00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:03.129
You know some big spine.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4252-0
00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:02.859
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4256-0
00:36:05.369 --> 00:36:05.629
Good.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4260-0

Thank you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4272-0
00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:33.829
I think you're sexy.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4280-0
00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:36.249
OK, I have time.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4281-0
00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:36.489
All right, all over to you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4307-0
00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:47.842
OK, so let's move on to the
interface SSX document and if

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4307-1
00:36:47.842 --> 00:36:50.991
anyone on the call is not
interested in the interface

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4307-2
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:53.499
document, feel free to drop from
the call.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4310-0
00:36:54.469 --> 00:36:54.899
Thank you.

00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:59.779
Thank you everyone.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4318-0
00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:04.739
I'll share my screen.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4328-0
00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:19.629
Yeah, sure. You can see that
now.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4353-0
00:37:22.189 --> 00:37:26.827
So there were certain comments
initially on which we will be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4353-1
00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:31.466
updating at the time when when
the document is final and the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4353-2
00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:33.899
indexing needs to be done again.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4355-0
00:37:34.909 --> 00:37:35.239
Okay.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4370-0
00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:40.327
Ohh morning there were couple of
requirement. OK US all that you

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4370-1
00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:41.269
have also do.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4382-0
00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:46.243
I saw that there were certain
things Michael for upgrading

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4382-1
00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:47.229
this one also.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4393-0
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:51.019
There are couple of requirements
that really wanted to talk

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4393-1
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:51.309
about.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4395-0
00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:52.519
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4404-0
00:37:58.979 --> 00:38:01.399
Then you more than that first.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4446-0
00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:07.415
Okay so one is this in this
requirement. OK, so what's

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4446-1
00:38:07.415 --> 00:38:12.846
happening is that the IT the
requirement is asking that drug

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4446-2
00:38:12.846 --> 00:38:18.454
result should be populated as
not reported if the event if the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4446-3
00:38:18.454 --> 00:38:24.063
incoming file doesn't contain
causality. So I have checked the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4446-4
00:38:24.063 --> 00:38:24.419
the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4472-0
00:38:24.499 --> 00:38:29.587
The incoming file that so it's
regarding the issue number 180

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4472-1
00:38:29.587 --> 00:38:33.609
basically that you reported
earlier. OK, so the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4463-0
00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:31.389
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4471-0
00:38:32.459 --> 00:38:33.369
Ohh farm maybe?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4477-0
00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:36.619
Sorry, sorry Michael.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4484-0
00:38:37.129 --> 00:38:39.119
Before a foreign measures
report.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4486-0
00:38:40.019 --> 00:38:40.489
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4512-0
00:38:41.449 --> 00:38:44.839
So in that case, what was
happening is that there were

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4512-1
00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:48.785
only drug result mentioned, drug
reaction, relatedness block is

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4512-2
00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.449
not at all present in that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4563-0
00:38:51.469 --> 00:38:56.548
Okay, I'm more aware like I have
checked many of the other cases

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4563-1
00:38:56.548 --> 00:39:01.236
in production, I prepared a
query to check what all was the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4563-2
00:39:01.236 --> 00:39:05.690
behaviour in the production
environment also and for the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4563-3
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.613
similar situation where there is
no drug reaction, relatedness

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4563-4
00:39:10.613 --> 00:39:15.379
block event assessment, that tab
has no data at all because.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4583-0
00:39:16.049 --> 00:39:20.179
When does that if, if we have
drug reaction lateness, then

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4583-1
00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:23.119
only it'll be populating data
based upon.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4630-0
00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:27.770
Ohh and based upon whatever was
the was the input and it will be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4630-1
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.759
updating that in the case now if
it doesn't have any data it

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4630-2
00:39:31.759 --> 00:39:35.683
won't be reading any value. In
order to manipulate that and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4630-3
00:39:35.683 --> 00:39:39.346
update update that event
assessment because there is no

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4630-4
00:39:39.346 --> 00:39:42.289
mapping available between
product and event.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4642-0
00:39:43.029 --> 00:39:47.639
So that is the reason that this
wasn't getting populated.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4675-0
00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:55.063
So that is the reason, Michael,
that this this is not operated

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4675-1
00:39:55.063 --> 00:39:59.164
at the time when we don't have
any data and drug reaction

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4675-2
00:39:59.164 --> 00:40:03.405
returns block. If you allow me
I'll I'll show you the final

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4675-3
00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:03.759
also.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-0
00:40:23.249 --> 00:40:27.254
3 over here there is no such
data in the drug law or drug

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-1
00:40:27.254 --> 00:40:31.812
reaction redness. Ideally, if we
see any XML file for product and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-2
00:40:31.812 --> 00:40:36.093
event mapping, we have a drug
reaction lateness blog based on

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-3
00:40:36.093 --> 00:40:40.444
that only drug result data is
like Argos gets to know where to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-4
00:40:40.444 --> 00:40:44.863
complete drug, drug relatedness
data and based upon the mapping

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4744-5
00:40:44.863 --> 00:40:46.659
between event and product.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4767-0
00:40:47.729 --> 00:40:50.802
So in this situation we have
checked in the production

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4767-1
00:40:50.802 --> 00:40:54.042
environment that identified
various cases. If you want, I

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4767-2
00:40:54.042 --> 00:40:56.109
can and I can show you that as
well.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4795-0
00:40:56.669 --> 00:41:02.080
Ohh, so now that that's the
situation over here that August,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4795-1
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.490
can't read that block. And if it
can't read that block it it

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4795-2
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.619
doesn't update anything.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4820-0
00:41:10.449 --> 00:41:14.052
And and causality one because
there is no such mapping

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4820-1
00:41:14.052 --> 00:41:18.049
presently exist. So once that
mapping exists in the Argus OK

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4820-2
00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:21.259
then only it shall be able to
update it because.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4838-0
00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:27.483
It has created a set of joins
and created rows in August after

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4838-1
00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:28.729
importing only.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4849-0
00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:34.029
Okay. So if we look back at the
the Word document.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4858-0
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:37.819
Can we add some notes in here
explaining this?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4866-0
00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:41.289
Yes, yes, definitely I cannot
die.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4881-0
00:41:42.509 --> 00:41:45.409
And the same for the the next
one, the 182.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4889-0
00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:47.709
So I think that you're very
soon.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4888-0
00:41:46.419 --> 00:41:47.519
Yeah. OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4905-0
00:41:48.969 --> 00:41:53.493
What is sort of, you know, no
due to constraints of the out of

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4905-1
00:41:53.493 --> 00:41:55.719
the box logic, this only works.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4918-0
00:41:56.549 --> 00:41:59.993
When such and such is present or
something, you know you know

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4918-1
00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:01.049
incoming like that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4920-0
00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:01.369
Sure, my girl.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4932-0
00:42:02.379 --> 00:42:06.529
I I can do that and you know the
situation in next next.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4939-0
00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:09.159
Is it if you wanted to do also
right?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4944-0
00:42:09.709 --> 00:42:10.429
It's similar.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4943-0
00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:10.549
So.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4957-0
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:14.881
Yeah, it's it's kind of similar.
Yeah, it has no date and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4957-1
00:42:14.881 --> 00:42:15.979
reaction basically.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4960-0
00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:17.329
Where is that?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4966-0
00:42:18.919 --> 00:42:20.649
They would also doesn't have
drug.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4970-0
00:42:21.169 --> 00:42:21.499
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4971-0
00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:21.949
Talk.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4977-0
00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.909
Reaction assessment block there
either does it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5004-0
00:42:25.679 --> 00:42:29.617
Right. So basically it doesn't
have both the situation. First

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/4984-0
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:26.879
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5004-1
00:42:29.617 --> 00:42:33.300
is it doesn't have reaction at
all and next is rejection,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5004-2
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:33.999
little man.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5013-0
00:42:34.529 --> 00:42:35.639
Yes, if you can mention.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5014-0
00:42:34.649 --> 00:42:36.009
So if it doesn't.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5023-0
00:42:36.709 --> 00:42:38.049
Yeah, will mention that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5042-0
00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:40.799
With them, both of those things
in the note and put the same

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5042-1
00:42:40.799 --> 00:42:43.649
note on both the the elements
where the comments were.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5055-0
00:42:47.259 --> 00:42:51.186
Yeah, yeah. I don't know what,
and you can verify it after

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5055-1
00:42:51.186 --> 00:42:51.519
that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5057-0
00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:52.279
Right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5062-0
00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:55.449
I just have.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5066-0
00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:56.969
This one is.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5069-0
00:42:58.049 --> 00:43:00.269
Uh, it's.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5078-0
00:43:03.049 --> 00:43:06.879
OK. The other one, regarding the
this is.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5081-0
00:43:07.629 --> 00:43:08.659
J9 J, 10.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5123-0
00:43:09.459 --> 00:43:14.755
Yeah, Jen and Jen. So Michael,
we followed up with Oracle

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5123-1
00:43:14.755 --> 00:43:20.052
earlier as as we discussed,
yeah, they they raised a bug.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5100-0
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:17.309
Yeah, I saw that.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5107-0
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.329
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5123-2
00:43:20.052 --> 00:43:26.078
And also we asked our Cardiff if
they can provide any update like

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5123-3
00:43:26.078 --> 00:43:26.809
any any.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5179-0
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:31.564
Ohh timeline or any update on
that when this issue this bug

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5179-1
00:43:31.564 --> 00:43:36.241
will be resolved. Then they said
that they they'll follow this

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5179-2
00:43:36.241 --> 00:43:40.770
process and it will be moved to
some different team and then

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5179-3
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:45.373
then they'll analyse and further
work on it. So we don't have

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5179-4
00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:49.159
exactly exact time when when
this can be verified.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5183-0
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:51.079
Yeah, at least 2 years.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5192-0
00:43:53.059 --> 00:43:56.399
Ohh, so understood that that's
not a problem.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5242-0
00:43:57.779 --> 00:44:01.163
Where instruct going to give
some instructions the users who

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5242-1
00:44:01.163 --> 00:44:04.326
work on their cases and take it
from there. But from the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5210-0
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:02.769
Right, nothing.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5242-2
00:44:04.326 --> 00:44:07.766
validation perspective, what's
the next step? Cause I was the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5231-0
00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:07.869
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5242-3
00:44:07.766 --> 00:44:11.039
code, the requirements are
already signed off in the UFOs.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5249-0
00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:13.199
That's right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5258-0
00:44:13.049 --> 00:44:16.759
The cold the code is being
implemented per the requirement.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5269-0
00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:22.649
That's fine, but what do we do?
We where do we describe the?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5296-0
00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:27.360
Oracle Bug and the essentially
this can't be tested. Do we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5296-1
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.404
mention it in the traceability
matrix? Do we mention it as a

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5296-2
00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:33.989
deviation or in the summary
report or?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5305-0
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:37.729
I don't know. So we need to work
out.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5306-0
00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:38.099
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5330-0
00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:44.119
I think either in I don't know
whether some traceability we can

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5310-0
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.809
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5330-1
00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:48.259
detail out so much, but summer
report is one option.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5343-0
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:52.669
We can discuss with the Puneeth
once where to mention this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5335-0
00:44:49.379 --> 00:44:49.599
You.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5363-0
00:44:53.249 --> 00:44:56.887
Yeah, cause I mean traceability.
Obviously if we know about the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5363-1
00:44:56.887 --> 00:44:59.559
issue, we intentionally don't
test it because.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5377-0
00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:03.580
Of the issue then, the
traceability needs to mention

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5377-1
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.589
the gap as to why it's not
tested.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5394-0
00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.683
Yeah, being excel file, we can
add one columns, comments,

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5394-1
00:45:11.683 --> 00:45:14.429
something of that sort for that
and.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5399-0
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:16.199
Yeah, I think there's generally
a comments comma.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5408-0
00:45:18.979 --> 00:45:20.989
At all we can discuss with the
Puneeth on this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5422-0
00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:24.869
Yes. So what else can you do?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5421-0
00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:24.429
Yeah. So for this document.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5459-0
00:45:26.189 --> 00:45:30.299
Microsoft, can we do one thing
that maybe we can talk to Puneet

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5459-1
00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:34.281
on this and in Monday we can
spare 5 minutes on this part and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5459-2
00:45:34.281 --> 00:45:38.134
have a conclusion on this. So
that as as is document can be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5459-3
00:45:38.134 --> 00:45:39.419
moved forward right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5488-0
00:45:41.129 --> 00:45:45.093
Yeah, I think I'm fine with the
SSX document part here for this.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5471-0
00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:44.799
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5488-1
00:45:45.093 --> 00:45:48.874
It's just a matter, Harrison
said. We need to talk about this

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5478-0
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:46.369
OK, OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5487-0
00:45:48.649 --> 00:45:49.089
Sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5488-2
00:45:48.874 --> 00:45:49.179
with.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5517-0
00:45:50.519 --> 00:45:54.717
So what we can do is Rahul we
can just update action item and

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5494-0
00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:51.409
Validation.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5517-1
00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:59.050
you know the track it in that.
So that either summary report or

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5515-0
00:45:57.639 --> 00:45:58.729
Fun time, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5517-2
00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.389
yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5519-0
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.439
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5528-0
00:46:01.929 --> 00:46:03.069
Yes, sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5534-0
00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:05.529
That way you know the SSX can be
taken forward.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5536-0
00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:06.349
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5546-0
00:46:06.779 --> 00:46:09.159
Chromosome. That's fine. Thank
you.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5548-0
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:11.429
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5561-0
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.798
Nothing. The only other one was
you need to send me some

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5561-1
00:46:14.798 --> 00:46:16.129
evidence of the email testing.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5584-0
00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:20.797
Yes, yes, my dear. So we'll
share that while separate mail

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5584-1
00:46:20.797 --> 00:46:25.156
KR team is pulling things out
and will be sharing it with you

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5580-0
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:24.169
Because we have.

00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:29.898
Cause we haven't received any
emails from the debt environment

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5596-1
00:46:29.898 --> 00:46:30.479
on our side.

codeless mapping updates into
it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5752-0

00:47:49.145 --> 00:47:51.789
mentioned IQ gets the code list
mapping update.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5782-0
00:47:53.509 --> 00:47:54.659

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5828-0
00:48:05.129 --> 00:48:09.213
We have, we had it in our list
and we'll work on it to update

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5828-1
00:48:09.213 --> 00:48:11.519

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5864-0
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:23.905
Maybe I I'll have it in mind.
So, Michael, I guess these were

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5864-1
00:48:23.905 --> 00:48:28.736
all the moments that we that we
provided in interface St 6

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5864-2
00:48:28.736 --> 00:48:29.719
document so.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5910-0
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:35.099
Yeah. So wait for you for you to
update on those 2 items. We need

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5910-1
00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:39.819
181 before we do that. So the 2
items, 180 and 182, you'll

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5891-0
00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:39.519
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5910-2
00:48:39.819 --> 00:48:44.619
update the notes. There was
another comment there about the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5910-3
00:48:44.619 --> 00:48:45.899
issue 20 and 21.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5915-0
00:48:46.919 --> 00:48:48.219
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5924-0
00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:50.519
Gonna start, we sort of cluster.
We jumped.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5926-0
00:48:51.579 --> 00:48:51.889
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5941-0
00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:57.679
Here so 2020 and 21 were the,
you know, the system wasn't

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5941-1
00:48:57.679 --> 00:49:00.189
working per the requirement.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5956-0
00:49:01.799 --> 00:49:04.264
They were just code bugs and
there was number impact on this

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5956-1
00:49:04.264 --> 00:49:05.799
document. Is that what you're
saying?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5965-0
00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:10.529
This issue 20 improvement from
the issue log items.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5984-0
00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:13.800
Yeah, they were from like the
the early the first round of

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5972-0
00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:12.329
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5978-0
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:13.719
I.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5984-1
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.509
testing we did for siren, the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5991-0
00:49:16.479 --> 00:49:19.839
Yeah, I'll. I'll open them with
you. I have them.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/5994-0
00:49:26.059 --> 00:49:26.749
You know this was.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6024-0
00:49:30.669 --> 00:49:35.056
And there was this 20, this
funny era that also came up in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6024-1
00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:39.295
some testing for licensed
partner, I think. And then you

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6024-2
00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:42.939
fixed it and then set 21 is more
detailed about.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6031-0
00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:47.269
Um particular data, not mapping.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6039-0
00:49:50.799 --> 00:49:52.469
And then you fixed it and then
it worked.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6058-0
00:49:54.169 --> 00:49:57.371
Why don't have any insight into
what was fixed on either of

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6058-1
00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:00.199
these issues? So I don't know if
there's any impact.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6068-0
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:04.779
Michael, I'll I'll check this
issues and.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6096-0
00:50:05.729 --> 00:50:09.718
And update it in the command
like what we actually fixed OK

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6082-0
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:09.419
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6096-1
00:50:09.718 --> 00:50:13.441
and if needed then I'll update
the update. Tested since

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6096-2
00:50:13.441 --> 00:50:14.239
document OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6099-0
00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:14.999
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6103-0
00:50:15.649 --> 00:50:16.929
Good. What must I?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6111-0
00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:25.239
Help your mother, huh? Anything
else?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6133-0
00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:31.928
Thanks, Michael. So I think we
are almost there. So the next

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6119-0
00:50:30.059 --> 00:50:30.229
It.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6133-1
00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:35.009
day is the Argos SSX, I hope
once.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6135-0
00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:36.449
That's tough one.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6152-0
00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:44.917
Yeah, trying to clear one one so
that we are good for the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6139-0
00:50:40.289 --> 00:50:40.679
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6152-1
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:45.799
validation.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6161-0
00:50:45.049 --> 00:50:49.879

00:50:56.339 --> 00:51:01.853
Michael I I realised like there
was a code change in this

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6208-1
00:51:01.853 --> 00:51:07.461
OK&amp;RS got approved in in
first week of April and we we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6208-2
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:11.169
fixed this part. I think earlier
only.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6227-0
00:51:12.509 --> 00:51:16.662
So that yeah, that's the reason
that it's already captured in

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6214-0
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:13.089
Ohh, I said.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6227-1

00:51:20.169 --> 00:51:24.009
I'll I'll still confirm like
what was the issue and what we

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6241-1
00:51:24.009 --> 00:51:24.649
fixed, OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6245-0
00:51:25.279 --> 00:51:26.049
Okay, thank you.

Tell him when I was sending
them, but.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6257-0
00:51:35.999 --> 00:51:36.389
No.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6259-0
00:51:36.989 --> 00:51:37.209
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6262-0
00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:41.439
So on the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6266-0
00:51:42.239 --> 00:51:43.749
Actually front Michael.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6273-0
00:51:46.809 --> 00:51:49.969
Other than Taiwan or related?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6280-0
00:51:51.219 --> 00:51:53.929
Things any other pending.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6277-0
00:51:52.139 --> 00:51:52.529
Yes.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6288-0
00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:57.309
I believe no, but just wanted to
confirm.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6293-0
00:52:02.929 --> 00:52:04.359
I also believe no.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6297-0
00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:06.149
Ohh, hang on a second.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6299-0
00:52:06.499 --> 00:52:06.799
What's?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6304-0
00:52:14.689 --> 00:52:15.859
Just looking for a list.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6306-0
00:52:19.249 --> 00:52:19.579
Sure.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6313-0
00:52:28.299 --> 00:52:30.459
That's Korea email
configuration.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6333-0
00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:35.596
But that's like tied to Taiwan
in a in a sense, if we haven't

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6333-1
00:52:35.596 --> 00:52:38.727
got Taiwan working, we've got no
chance of getting career

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6333-2
00:52:38.727 --> 00:52:39.159
working.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6335-0
00:52:40.649 --> 00:52:40.889
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6338-0
00:52:49.509 --> 00:52:49.959
Done.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6355-0
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:58.645
So just to summarise this
Taiwan, we are able to send to

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6345-0
00:52:55.419 --> 00:52:55.749
On the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6355-1
00:52:58.645 --> 00:52:59.499
them, right?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6362-0
00:53:01.259 --> 00:53:02.789
Yes, sure. I will send emails.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6386-0
00:53:04.979 --> 00:53:07.934
But there was a lot of emails
kind the other day, apparently

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6386-1
00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:11.035
due to some bug and some testing
and stuff, so I'm retesting it

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6386-2
00:53:11.035 --> 00:53:12.149
trying to retest today.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6385-0
00:53:11.129 --> 00:53:12.309
Yes. Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6397-0
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:16.729
On the inbound email parts, also
trying to test today.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6390-0
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:14.069
So.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6399-0
00:53:17.409 --> 00:53:17.739
OK.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6419-0
00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:22.112
So once you confirm then I hope
we can move, you know the if it

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6419-1
00:53:22.112 --> 00:53:25.299
is, you know the satisfies our
requirement then we can.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6422-0
00:53:26.489 --> 00:53:27.659
Set it for scoria.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6426-0
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:29.339
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6432-0
00:53:32.099 --> 00:53:34.089
And the other thing the.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6445-0
00:53:35.399 --> 00:53:40.316
Connectivity from move it to the
in and out folders needs to be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6445-1
00:53:40.316 --> 00:53:41.699
worked on I think.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6456-0
00:53:42.689 --> 00:53:45.739
So this will set up the move
that thing, but I'm not quite

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6456-1
00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:46.049
clear.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6474-0
00:53:46.949 --> 00:53:50.517
If that's working all correctly
yet, so I puts it quite a few

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6474-1
00:53:50.517 --> 00:53:52.129
comments on that in the CBD.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6476-0
00:53:54.929 --> 00:53:55.399
Okay.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6483-0
00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.239
Ohh what time?

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6490-0
00:53:57.679 --> 00:54:01.459
But some difference destinations
like swissmedic for example.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6500-0
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:06.219
Instead of using axway it should
use move it.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6529-0
00:54:08.419 --> 00:54:12.167
So hopefully you know between
the CBD and once we get the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6529-1
00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:16.108
appendix for the 80s X with the
details in it, then we'll be

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6529-2
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.659
able to figure that out.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6532-0
00:54:20.049 --> 00:54:20.719
Yeah, but.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6545-0
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:26.932
Ohh it is what I'm thinking is
move it I understand but

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6545-1
00:54:26.932 --> 00:54:28.419
actually switching.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6548-0
00:54:28.929 --> 00:54:29.919
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6550-0
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:30.709
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6557-0
00:54:32.189 --> 00:54:33.869
Here's what I'm thinking from
uh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6561-0
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:36.099
Sometime next week maybe.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6563-0
00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:36.989
Yeah.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6578-0
00:54:39.159 --> 00:54:41.593
Because we have to raise ticket
and then, you know, they get

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6578-1
00:54:41.593 --> 00:54:43.389
things done. So again there will
be some SL.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6575-0
00:54:42.339 --> 00:54:42.599
Ohh.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6583-0
00:54:44.729 --> 00:54:46.719
Yeah, OK, well, let's.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6599-0
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:51.608
Hopefully get this Taiwan stuff
done and then we can set the

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6599-1
00:54:51.608 --> 00:54:51.939
date.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6609-0
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:55.977
Yeah, because in Calster data
center, everything moves on

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6609-1
00:54:55.977 --> 00:54:56.269
Slas.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6614-0
00:54:57.009 --> 00:54:57.559
Which are in.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6620-0
00:54:58.979 --> 00:55:00.049
Not in our control.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6625-0
00:55:00.899 --> 00:55:02.929
Who is this? I'll strip to
escalate.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6638-0
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:08.613
So it is like it. I am
escalating everything alternate

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6638-1
00:55:08.613 --> 00:55:09.439

quickly.

d68b59b1-a586-4c61-a8e1-955ec5fb9a4a/6651-0
00:55:15.799 --> 00:55:17.609

OK, no nothing else for now.

Yeah, thank you. I don't think.
